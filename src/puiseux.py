Module: puiseux_expansions.py

Description:
    This module computes Puiseux series expansions for algebraic functions defined by a polynomial f(x, y).
    Puiseux series are generalized power series that allow fractional exponents and are useful in studying
    singular points in algebraic geometry. The module leverages symbolic computation via sympy to perform
    the expansion.

Functions:
    cross(o, a, b):
        Computes the 2D cross product (determinant) of vectors defined by the points o, a, and b.
        This is used for determining the orientation of three points and is fundamental in computing the convex hull.

    lower_convex_hull(points):
        Computes the lower convex hull (or lower envelope) of a set of 2D points.
        The lower convex hull is used to extract the contributing monomials from the polynomial's support
        for determining the initial series branch.

    get_support(expr, x, y):
        Extracts the support (the exponent set) of a bivariate polynomial expression.
        The support is returned as a list of tuples (i, j, coeff) representing monomials x^i * y^j with their coefficients.

    initial_branches(f, x, y, deg=0):
        Determines the initial Puiseux branches of the polynomial f(x, y) by analyzing its support.
        It computes the lower convex hull of the exponent points and then extracts candidate series branches
        in the form u*x^(theta). These candidates serve as starting points for the series expansion.

    puiseux_expansions(f, x, y, max_terms=5):
        Iteratively computes the Puiseux series expansions of f(x, y) up to a specified maximum number
        of terms. At each iteration, the method refines the current expansion by substituting the previous
        approximation, then extracting and appending the next term in the series.
        
Usage Example:
    1. Define the symbols x and y using sympy.symbols.
    2. Set up a polynomial f(x, y).
    3. Call puiseux_expansions(f, x, y, max_terms) to generate the series.
    4. Display the results and save them to a text file with attractive formatting.

Output File:
    The generated file "puiseux_expansions.txt" begins with a decorative header, lists the numbered expansions
    each separated by a horizontal line, and ends with a footer.
